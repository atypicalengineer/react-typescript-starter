react-typescript-starter
A starter project using React with Typescript with all the latest stuff.
This is a much thinner project than create-react-app, for example this
project doesn't include Babel.

Install the dependencies: 
npm install

Run the project:
npm start

You can change the configuration in config/webpack.config.js. It may be 
on interest to you that you can:
- Change whether or not the browser opens when you run npm start (default is true)
- Change the port that your application runs on (default is 8020)
